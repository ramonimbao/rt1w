# Usage

Run the program with `cargo run --release`. You can also give it a JSON configuration file as an argument to change the render settings without having to recompile the program using `--config [config.json]`. Scene loading is also now supported using `--scene [scene.json]`.

Example:  
`$ rt1w --scene res/scenes/texture-test.json --config res/config/front-good.json`

Rendering the default scene with the `good.json` config (800Ã—600 at 100 samples/pixel) takes almost 19 minutes.

# To Do

- Implement being able to input random materials via JSON.
- Implement `--verbose` option input to display all messages.
- Implement Triangle shape.
- Implement OBJ model loading.
